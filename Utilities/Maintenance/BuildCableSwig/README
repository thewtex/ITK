This directory contains the skeleton CMakeLists.txt to download, build
and install CableSwig. It is implemented in two parts:

1. CMakeLists.txt, which has a recipe to build CableSwig using the
CMake ExternalProject module.

2. BuildCableSwig.sh, which is a script which automate the whole
process.

This only works on Unix and OS X; to build CableSwig on Windows,
you can still use the CMakeLists.txt, but you'll have to configure and
build yourself, since Windows lacks a Bourne SHell.

THE SCRIPT

Usage: BuildCableSwig.sh [build-directory] [install-prefix]

You must specify a directory in which to build CableSwig, and the
prefix path where you wish to have it installed.

Once you've built and installed CableSwig, to use it in ITK, you must
set CableSwig_DIR to ${install-prefix}/lib/CableSwig.  For example

BuildCableSwig.sh /scratch/CableSwig /opt/CableSwig

cd ITK-build
cmake -DCableSwig_DIR:PATH=/opt/CableSwig/lib/CableSwig ../ITK
