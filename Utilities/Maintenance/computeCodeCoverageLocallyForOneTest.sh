#
#  How to use this script
#
#   0)  Use Linux or Mac
#
#   1)  Add the CMake flags:
#
#       CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-g -O0  -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
#       CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING= -g -O0  -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
#
#   2)  Compile ITK for Debug
#
#                     CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  Debug
#
#   3)  From the binary directory type the "ctest" expression that select the
#       tests that you want use to generate coverage (Ideally this should only
#       need to be the unit tests of the class in question).
#
#       For example:
#
#                ctest  -R   itkHDF5ImageIOTest   -V   -N
#
#       This will print to the console the command line instructions needed to
#       run the tests (-V option), but without running the tests (-N option).
#
#   4)  From the binary directory type the path to this script in the ITK
#       source tree and add the selection expression that you put in front
#       of ctest.
#
#       For example:
#
#          compliancecomputeCodeCoverageLocallyForOneTest.sh    \
#                     -R    itkHDF5ImageIOTest
#
#
#       This will run the selected tests in ITK and generate code coverage for
#       the entire toolkit, but only from the test that you have selected. The
#       code coverage report will be generated in HTML and will be presented
#       with Firefox.
