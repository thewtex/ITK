echo "   "
echo "   0)  Use Linux or Mac   "
echo "   "
echo "   1)  Add the CMake flags:   "
echo "   "
echo "       CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-g -O0  -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage   "
echo "       CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING= -g -O0  -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage   "
echo "   "
echo "   2)  Compile ITK for Debug   "
echo "   "
echo "                     CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  Debug   "
echo "   "
echo "   3)  From the binary directory type the "ctest" expression that select the   "
echo "       tests that you want use to generate coverage (Ideally this should only   "
echo "       need to be the unit tests of the class in question).   "
echo "   "
echo "       For example:   "
echo "   "
echo "                ctest  -R   itkHDF5ImageIOTest   -V   -N   "
echo "   "
echo "       This will print to the console the command line instructions needed to   "
echo "       run the tests (-V option), but without running the tests (-N option).   "
echo "   "
echo "   4)  From the binary directory type the path to this script in the ITK   "
echo "       source tree and add the selection expression that you put in front   "
echo "       of ctest in numeral (3) above.   "
echo "   "
echo "       More specifically, for example:   "
echo "   "
echo "        computeCodeCoverageLocallyForOneTest.sh -R  itkHDF5ImageIOTest   "
echo "   "
echo "   "
echo "       This will run the selected tests in ITK and generate code coverage for   "
echo "       the entire toolkit, but only from the test that you have selected. The   "
echo "       code coverage report will be generated in HTML can be opened with your   "
echo "       favorite browser.                                                        "
echo "       For example, "
echo "    "
echo "          In Linux, you can do        firefox  ./index.html     "
echo "          In Mac,   you can do        open     ./index.html     "
