This repository contains the mechanisms for
Modularizing the Insight Toolkit ITK.

The scripts in this repository perform the
Modularization if ITK by:

1) Taking the standard Git checkout of ITK.

2) Creating destination directories for each module.

3) Copying files from (1) into (2).

4) Generating configuration files for each module.


At this point, this code is experimental and you
should treat it as an "Alpha Release" level code.

You are welcome to try it, but don't be surprised
if it is not fully working yet.

Please post any questions to the ITK Developers
mailing list.
