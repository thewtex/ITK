The modularized build system is not yet mature in at least these areas:

 - The Examples directory is not included in the build.

 - The Wrapping directory is not included in the build.

 - Doxygen processing has not been attempted.

 - BUILD_SHARED_LIBS on Windows does not work.  This requires sweeping
   dllexport markup changes which can work only after modularization.

 - Several try_compile tests and platform-specific build flags have yet
   to be ported from the monolithic build system.

 - The install tree layout has not been tested.  The third-party
   utility headers in particular may need adjustment.

Futher work will refine the new build system code moving forward.
