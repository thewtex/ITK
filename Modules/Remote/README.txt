This is a directory holder for all remote modules that are distribued outside
ITK's main repository.  Remote modules share the same structures as modules in
the main repository.  They will be picked up by the configuration system and
entered into the build after they are placed in this directory.

Modules can be easily downloaded and accessible to the community by listing
module in the CMakeLists.txt of the current directory.
